# Lodestone_teleport
A minecraft datepack to enable teleporting using lodestones and lodestone compasses.

Heavily inspired on lodeport. https://github.com/NicolasBissig/Lodeport

### Installation

This datapack comes with a resourcepack allowing translations and/or altering of all messages should these be desired. To use this both the datapack and resourcepack need to be enabled. Without the resourcepack only the default fallback messages will appear.
